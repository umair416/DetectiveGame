# JAVA TUTORIAL – TEAM-BASED CODING ACTIVITY
# THE MISSING EXAM PAPER: A DETECTIVE INVESTIGATION SYSTEM
1. Objective
In this tutorial, students will work in teams of four to develop a small Java-based Detective Investigation System. The activity is designed to provide hands-on practice with classes, objects, constructors, methods, arrays, control statements, and basic Git/GitHub collaboration.
Each team will develop one complete Java application by dividing the work into four separate Java files. Each student will be responsible for one part of the application and will contribute their work to a common GitHub repository using GitHub Codespaces.

2. Problem Statement
An important examination question paper has disappeared from the department office one day before the examination.
Five students were present in the department during the time of the incident. Your team has been assigned the task of developing a console-based Detective Investigation System in Java to investigate the suspects, examine clues, and identify the culprit.
The program should simulate an investigation using predefined data and choices.
The completed application should allow the detective to:
1.	View the suspects.
2.	Investigate a particular suspect.
3.	Collect clues.
4.	View collected clues.
5.	Accuse a suspect.
6.	Determine whether the accusation is correct.
7.	Exit the investigation.
Note: User input using Scanner is NOT required for this activity.
________________________________________
3. Suspect Information
The following five suspects are involved in the investigation:
ID	Suspect	Location	Alibi
1	Alex	Computer Lab	Working on a project
2	Maya	Library	Studying
3	Rahul	Staff Room	Meeting a faculty member
4	Sara	Canteen	Having lunch
5	Arjun	Department Office	Collecting documents
The actual culprit should not be directly displayed to the detective at the beginning of the investigation.
________________________________________
4. Available Clues
The investigation contains the following clues:
1.	The office door was opened at 2:15 PM.
2.	CCTV shows someone entering the office.
3.	A torn piece of paper was found near the printer.
4.	A suspect's ID card was found inside the office.
5.	The printer was used shortly before the question paper disappeared.
The clues should be stored using an array.
The program should also keep track of which clues have been collected.
________________________________________
5. Team Structure
Each team will consist of FOUR students.
Each student will be responsible for one Java file.
Student 1 – Suspect Management
File: Suspect.java
Responsible for creating and managing the Suspect class.
Student 2 – Clue Management
File: ClueManager.java
Responsible for creating and managing the clues.
Student 3 – Investigation and Accusation
File: Investigation.java
Responsible for investigating suspects and handling the accusation logic.
Student 4 – Main Program and Integration
File: DetectiveGame.java
Responsible for the main program, menu, program flow, and integration of all components.
________________________________________
6. Student 1 – Suspect Management
File: Suspect.java
The student should:
1.	Create a class named Suspect.
2.	Create suitable data members for:
o	Suspect ID
o	Suspect name
o	Location
o	Alibi
3.	Create a constructor to initialize the data members.
4.	Use the this keyword inside the constructor.
5.	Create five Suspect objects.
6.	Store the objects in an array.
7.	Create a method to display the details of a suspect.
8.	Create a method to display all suspects.
The class should be designed so that the other parts of the program can access the suspect information when required.
________________________________________
7. Student 2 – Clue Management
File: ClueManager.java
The student should:
1.	Create an array containing the five clues.
2.	Create a mechanism to track which clues have been collected.
3.	Create a method to display the available clues.
4.	Create a method to collect a clue using a predefined clue number.
5.	Create a method to display all collected clues.
6.	Ensure that a clue cannot be collected more than once.
________________________________________
8. Student 3 – Investigation and Accusation
File: Investigation.java
The student should:
1.	Create a method to search for a suspect using the suspect ID.
2.	Display the details of the selected suspect.
3.	Create the accusation logic.
4.	Compare the accused suspect with the actual culprit.
5.	Allow a maximum of three accusation attempts.
6.	Display an appropriate message when the accusation is correct.
7.	Display an appropriate message when all three attempts are used.
8.	Use suitable if-else, loops, break, and return statements where appropriate.
________________________________________
9. Student 4 – Main Program and Integration
File: DetectiveGame.java
The student should:
1.	Create the main() method.
2.	Create the objects required by the program.
3.	Display the main investigation menu.
4.	Use a switch statement for menu selection.
5.	Use a loop to repeat the investigation.
6.	Call the methods created by the other three students.
7.	Integrate the suspect, clue, and investigation components.
8.	Compile and test the complete application.
9.	Work with the other team members to resolve integration errors.
________________________________________
10. Main Investigation Menu
The completed program should provide a menu similar to the following:
=================================
     DETECTIVE INVESTIGATION
=================================

1. View Suspects
2. Investigate Suspect
3. Collect Clue
4. View Collected Clues
5. Accuse Suspect
6. Exit
The program should repeatedly perform the selected operation until the investigation is completed or the detective chooses to exit.
________________________________________
11. Program Requirements
Option 1 – View Suspects
Display the details of all five suspects.
Option 2 – Investigate Suspect
Use a predefined suspect ID to identify and display the details of a particular suspect.
If the ID does not match any suspect, display an appropriate message.
Option 3 – Collect Clue
Allow the detective to select a clue using a predefined clue number.
The selected clue should be marked as collected.
A clue that has already been collected should not be collected again.
Option 4 – View Collected Clues
Display all clues that have been collected so far.
If no clues have been collected, display an appropriate message.
Option 5 – Accuse Suspect
Allow the detective to make an accusation using a predefined suspect ID.
The detective should have a maximum of three attempts.
If the correct suspect is identified:
CASE SOLVED!

You identified the culprit.
The missing question paper has been recovered.
If all three attempts are incorrect:
INVESTIGATION FAILED!

You have used all three attempts.
The culprit escaped.
Option 6 – Exit
Terminate the investigation.

12. Java Concepts to be Used
The completed project should demonstrate the following Java concepts:
•	Classes
•	Objects
•	Reference variables
•	Constructors
•	this keyword
•	Methods
•	Arrays
•	Array of objects
•	if-else statements
•	switch statement
•	for loop
•	for-each loop
•	while or do-while loop
•	break statement
•	continue statement
•	return statement
•	Primitive data types
•	Strings
Important
Scanner and user-input handling are not required for this activity because they have not yet been covered in class.
The program should therefore use predefined values to demonstrate the investigation.
________________________________________
13. Project Structure
Each team should have ONE GitHub repository containing the following files:
detective-investigation/
│
├── Suspect.java
├── ClueManager.java
├── Investigation.java
├── DetectiveGame.java
